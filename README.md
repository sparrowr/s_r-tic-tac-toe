# Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic-tac-toe game project built by Sparrow Rubin at General Assembly's
Web Development Immersive.

The deployed version is [here](https://sparrowr.github.io/s_r-tic-tac-toe/).

## Structure

JavaScript files are all in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts). The "manifest"
or entry-point is [`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). That
file invokes [`assets/scripts/events.js`](assets/scripts/events.js), which
contains event listeners for the two buttons visible on the screen when the app
is accessed.

Specifically, the authentication content is handled in [`assets/scripts/auth`](assets/scripts/auth),
primarily in [`assets/scripts/auth/logic.js`](assets/scripts/auth/logic.js), and the game content is handled
in [`assets/scripts/game`](assets/scripts/game), primarily in [`assets/scripts/game/logic.js`](assets/scripts/game/logic.js).

`apiUrls.production` and `apiUrls.development` are configured in
[`config/environment.js`](config/environment.js).

Styles are stored in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and loaded
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss). Bootstrap version 3 is
included in this template.

[`getFormFields`](get-form-fields.md) is used to retrieve form data to send to an
API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA with this project, run `grunt deploy`.

## Planning Notes

Original wireframes for this project are in [`wireframes.jpg`](wireframes.jpg).

These user stories were derived from requirements, without contact with actual users:
- As a new user, I want to be able to sign up.
- As a returning user, I want to be able to sign in.
- As a player, I want to be able to place tokens on the board.
- As a player, I want to be able to tell if I have won or lost.
- As a player, I want to be able to play with friends.
- As a player, I want to be able to view previous games.
- As a player, I want to be able to navigate to different parts of the app without refreshing.
- As a player, I want to access this game on a public website.
- As a player, I want this website to be high-contrast and nice to look at.
- As a player, I don't want to encounter any error messages.
- As a player, I don't want my opponent to be able to place invalid tokens.
- As a player, I don't want the game to become unresponsive, frozen, or stuck.

I approached this project methodically, by taking notes and following the guidelines presented in class to design, build, and test components. I created the game itself, then the authentication system, then attached the game to the game API, then made several fixes to the UI and to this document.
